2010年爺爺過世的時候，爸爸到加州來陪奶奶，那是我第一次看到爸爸在奶奶的懷裏痛哭。當時我不知道該作甚麼，或怎樣反應，只知道在爸爸裏面有一種很深很深的痛。那時我真的不能體會；說實話，我也不想懂～但是在2021年8月26日，我體會到那種痛了，就是那種令人無法忍受，失去父親極深的痛苦。

在我成長的過程中，有許多看似平凡的事物對我來說是理所當然的。每個晚上我們總是坐在一塊兒吃晚餐，每個主日我們一定會去主日聚會，有時我們也會把家打開愛筵聖徒，再有甜美的交通－這也是為甚麼爸爸的蔥油餅那麼有名。我們常常跟大伯、大媽和堂哥、堂姐出去玩，爸爸會買魚、烏龜和蝦給我當寵物，因為他知道我喜歡水裏的生物。在我的記憶裏，從沒有看過爸爸媽媽吵架……這些看似微小的事情，帶給我和姐姐平凡、正常的童年。現在回頭看，我不得不感謝並讚美主，把我擺在這樣一個滿了神的愛的家庭裏。有許多神聖的益處早已播種在我們裏面，並在我們成立自己的家庭時開始收成。爸爸，我虧欠您太多！我真的很愛您！謝謝您照著神來養育我們，在我們裏面立下愛神並敬畏神的根基。

爸爸經歷了很多事情。我們剛移民美國的時候，有十年之久不在他身邊。後來，他的心臟瓣膜發炎，之後又被診斷出大腸癌，他短暫地戰勝病魔，但後來轉移至他的骨頭。我從來沒有聽他發過怨言，相反地，他是活出另一個生命。不管他的情形如何，他總是在主裏常常喜樂，主的喜樂就是他的力量。當我聽到許多聖徒的見證，說他們看到爸爸時，他總是很開心，這讓我想起保羅在腓立比書四章十一至十三節說，『我並不是因缺乏說這話，因為我已經學會了，無論在甚麼景況，都可以知足。我知道怎樣處卑賤，也知道怎樣處富餘；或飽足、或飢餓、或富餘、或缺乏，在各事上，並在一切事上，我都學得祕訣。我在那加我能力者的裏面，凡事都能作。』我的爸爸就是這樣一個事事處處都經歷基督並學得祕訣的人。

爸爸，謝謝你給我們作了美好的榜樣。我好想你！雖然你的離開很突然，但我知道這是主量給你的道路，你已經跑完當跑的賽程，安息在主懷裏。我要讚美主，賜給我一個這麼棒的父親，這樣美好的榜樣！我們必要在主裏再相見。

愛你，

My dearest Dad

When grandpa passed away in 2010, Dad came to California to be with Grandma. That was the first time I saw Dad crying in Grandma’s arms. I didn’t know what to do or how to react. I just knew there was this unfathomable pain within him. I didn’t understand it then. To be honest, I didn’t want to know. But on August 26, 2021, I understood that pain, that unbearable, deep pain of losing a father.

Growing up in my family, there were many ordinary things that I just took for granted. We always eat our dinner every night sitting together. Every Lord’s day we would go to the church meeting. Often we would have saints over for meals and fellowship. This was how his onion pancake became famous. We would go on family trips with uncle Da Bor, Da Ma, and our cousins. Dad would get pets such as fish, turtles, and shrimps for me because he knew I liked aquatic things. And I don’t ever recall witnessing my mom and dad fight in person. All these little things brought about an ordinary, normal childhood for me and my sister. Looking back now, I have to thank and praise the Lord for placing me in such a God-loving family. There were just so many divine benefits that were sown into us that we are just beginning to reap as we are starting our own family. Dad, I owe you so much. I love you so much. Thank you for raising us in such a Godly way, creating in us a foundation to love and fear God.

Dad went through a lot. He lived apart from us for ten years. He suffered a heart condition that resulted in a damaged heart valve. He was diagnosed with colon cancer. He defeated it briefly but later it metastasized to his bones. But I never once heard him complain through all this. Instead, he was living by another life. Regardless of his situation, he kept his joy in the Lord.  The joy of the Lord was really his strength.  When I heard all the saints’ testimonies about my dad, how he was always happy when they saw him, it reminded me of what Paul said in Philippians 4:11-13, “Not that I speak according to lack, for I have learned, in whatever circumstances I am, to be content. I know also how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to lack. I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me.” Dad was someone who learned the secret of experiencing Christ in everything and in every place.

Dad, thank you for being such a pattern to us. I miss you. I feel you are gone too soon. But I know this is what the Lord has measured for you. You have run the race, you have finished the course. You are resting in Him now. I praise the Lord for giving me such a wonderful Dad, a wonderful pattern. Till we meet again in the Lord,

Love,
Luh Luh
