真的不知道要從那裏說起，這一切對我來說還是很不真實。這幾天一直在想，爸爸的一生其實就只有這幾個：主耶穌，家，召會和聖徒。這就是爸爸一生所最愛的。

爸爸真的是一位愛主的人。在我很小的時候就知道，主耶穌是爸爸的最愛，是爸爸的首位。在我們家主耶穌是第一位，媽媽是第二位；因為爸爸愛媽媽，所以凡事都尊重她。週一到週五我們都是在爸爸晨興的聲音中起床的，週末是在爸爸唱詩歌的聲音中起床。爸爸很忙，忙工作、忙聚會、忙服事，但是爸爸還是會有時間來陪我們。媽媽每天下 回家煮飯，爸爸回家後我們開飯。吃完晚餐，有時候爸爸和媽媽就騎摩托車出門了。幾乎每個晚上都有事，事奉聚會、禱告聚會、叩門、發單張、小排。有時候我和弟弟也會跟爸爸媽媽一起，爸爸載我，媽媽載弟弟，騎著兩輛摩托車出去看望聖徒。這幾乎成了我們生活的日常。

我記得國小的時候，幾乎每個禮拜，爸爸都會請一批年輕的叔叔阿姨們一起吃飯，一起聚會，一起出去玩，一起去訪問教會；直到今天，看到他們還是覺得很親切。二十多年前，六會所要改建信基大樓的時候，我至今印象深刻，爸爸騎摩托車載我去看那塊地，說我們的會所以後就在這裏，會是全台北召會的一個地標。後來每蓋好一些我們都會去看一下，爸爸眼裏充滿了期待和感動。

爸爸對我們真的是一位慈父。記得以前就算是真的處罰我們，後來都會再跟我們說對不起。我在婚姻的路上走得有點坎坷，爸爸媽媽常說我的要求太高了，但其實是因為我有他們的榜樣在前面，我想要有跟我爸爸媽媽一樣的婚姻，和爸爸一樣的弟兄。記得有一次遇到這方面的難處時，爸爸看到我很難過，就寫了一封信給我。爸爸給了我一首詩歌，大本詩歌458首副歌説到：『每次的打擊，都是真利益，如果你收去的東西，你以自己來代替。』他說：「一切都是在主的許可裏，主讓這些事發生在我們身上，一定有祂的美意。我們若認識主，就知道祂是為著叫我們得益處，但前題是我們要愛祂。我們需要心轉向祂，向祂柔軟。女兒，希望你更愛祂。主說我們愛祂，必蒙父的愛，主也要愛他，並且要向他顯現。」

我很欣慰的是我讓爸爸嘗到一點含飴弄孫的滋味，那一種愛是我從爸爸那裏所未見的，是一種享受和溺愛。爸爸給他取小名叫安寶，希望他平平安安健健康康的長大。他最喜歡唱兒童詩歌給安寶聽，每一首他都背得好熟；他還會去查英文兒童詩歌的歌辭，就是為了要唱給安寶聽，希望他長大以後也是一個愛主的人。

我們實在有千萬的不捨，但是我們知道爸爸安息在主懷裏，卸下了身體上所有的疼痛和辛苦。
爸爸你辛苦了，好好休息罷！我們會好好照顧媽媽，你不用擔心。
我愛你，爸爸！

My dearest Dad
When grandpa passed away in 2010, Dad came to California to be with Grandma. That was the first time I saw Dad crying in Grandma’s arms. I didn’t know what to do or how to react. I just knew there was this unfathomable pain within him. I didn’t understand it then. To be honest, I didn’t want to know. But on August 26, 2021, I understood that pain, that unbearable, deep pain of losing a father.

Growing up in my family, there were many ordinary things that I just took for granted. We always eat our dinner every night sitting together. Every Lord’s day we would go to the church meeting. Often we would have saints over for meals and fellowship. This was how his onion pancake became famous. We would go on family trips with uncle Da Bor, Da Ma, and our cousins. Dad would get pets such as fish, turtles, and shrimps for me because he knew I liked aquatic things. And I don’t ever recall witnessing my mom and dad fight in person. All these little things brought about an ordinary, normal childhood for me and my sister. Looking back now, I have to thank and praise the Lord for placing me in such a God-loving family. There were just so many divine benefits that were sown into us that we are just beginning to reap as we are starting our own family. Dad, I owe you so much. I love you so much. Thank you for raising us in such a Godly way, creating in us a foundation to love and fear God.

Dad went through a lot. He lived apart from us for ten years. He suffered a heart condition that resulted in a damaged heart valve. He was diagnosed with colon cancer. He defeated it briefly but later it metastasized to his bones. But I never once heard him complain through all this. Instead, he was living by another life. Regardless of his situation, he kept his joy in the Lord.  The joy of the Lord was really his strength.  When I heard all the saints’ testimonies about my dad, how he was always happy when they saw him, it reminded me of what Paul said in Philippians 4:11-13, “Not that I speak according to lack, for I have learned, in whatever circumstances I am, to be content. I know also how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to lack. I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me.” Dad was someone who learned the secret of experiencing Christ in everything and in every place.

Dad, thank you for being such a pattern to us. I miss you. I feel you are gone too soon. But I know this is what the Lord has measured for you. You have run the race, you have finished the course. You are resting in Him now. I praise the Lord for giving me such a wonderful Dad, a wonderful pattern. Till we meet again in the Lord,

Love,
Luh Luh
